                    Learning institutions whose COVID-19 readiness plans have been approved by their provincial or territorial government will soon be able to welcome more international students back to their schools. Amended travel restrictions will take effect on October
                    20, allowing international students to enter Canada if their designated learning institution (DLI) has an approved COVID-19 readiness plan in place. With primary responsibility for education and health care, provincial and territorial
                    governments assess COVID-19 readiness plans that schools are putting in place. As part of their plans, DLIs are expected to provide specifics to their provincial or territorial government on how they will provide information to international
                    students on health and travel requirements before they arrive in Canada, help students with their quarantine plans and provide guidance or assistance in acquiring the necessities of life, such as food and medication, during their quarantine.
                    Readiness plans also need to establish protocols for the health of students in the event there are suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases at the school. The Government of Canada works closely with provinces and territories on the attraction
                    and hosting of international students in Canada and other issues related to international education. Provincial and territorial partners indicated they would like to see a process that allows international students to begin travelling
                    to Canada again, as long as it is done safely and respects health requirements. Taking a cautious approach, the federal, provincial and territorial governments have worked together in developing that process. The list of DLIs with
                    an approved COVID-19 readiness plan in place will be posted on IRCC’s web page for international students affected by COVID-19 restrictions and updated regularly as provinces and territories identify additional schools. This change
                    to travel restrictions affects all international students, regardless of where they are travelling from or when their study permit was approved. Like all travellers to Canada, international students and accompanying family members
                    will be subject to all public health measures, including the mandatory 14-day quarantine period upon arrival in Canada.
