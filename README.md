## Project description: 

### This project was created to help new immigrants to take the right path towards their goals. The project is very convenient because everything is simple and clear. Starting from registration, the user can find a suitable program for themselves, or the company's employees can help with this. You can even evaluate your chances for immigration yourself. Employees of the company can accompany you completely from the beginning to obtain citizenship. You can view important information about Express Entry. You can contact a company employee directly if you have any questions or leave a message. In the end, you can leave a review.
